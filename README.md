### Todo's :
  - [ ] shrink size by removing FontAwesome and use img directly
  - [ ] resize images
  - [ ] Use Roboto font & rm unneceesary fonts </br>
  - [ ] Testing of canvaskit and html rendering on both mobile and desktop for performance and space consumption. 
  
     Review from my friend [@muzam1l](https://github.com/muzam1l)ðŸ’©: 
  - [ ] Its 4mb and without gzipped, gzip it and it will go sub 1mb and your main bundle is 1.4mb, so it will be 200kb or so gzipped, and rest is fonts and icons, use single lighweight icon source or even isolated svg
